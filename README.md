# system-design-roadmap

A comprehensive learning roadmap and notes for mastering system design. This repository includes detailed explanations of fundamental concepts, networking, databases, microservices, scalability, performance optimization, and more, as outlined in the 2024 standards for system design.

Each section will later expand into specific **chapters**, with suggested implementation tasks like **drawing architectural diagrams, creating proof-of-concept projects, and coding small modules**.
